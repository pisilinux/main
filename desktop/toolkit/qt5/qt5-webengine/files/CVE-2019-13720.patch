Obtain graph/process lock when nullifying the buffer in Reverb

When the buffer is set to `null` while there is an active buffer
within a reverb object, SetBuffer() function can prematurely
nullify the `reverb_` and `shared_buffer_` while it is still
being accessed by the rendering thread.

This CL adds two locks (graph lock and process lock) when the
buffer gets nullified to ensure the synchronization between
two threads.

(cherry picked from commit 6a2e670a243b815cf043f8da4d26ecb9a64d307b)

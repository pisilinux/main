+# Qt Port of WebKit
+
+WebKit is an open source web browser engine. WebKit's HTML and JavaScript code began as a branch of the KHTML and KJS libraries from KDE. As part of KDE framework KHTML was based on Qt but during their porting efforts Apple's engineers made WebKit toolkit independent. QtWebKit is a project aiming at porting this fabulous engine back to Qt.
+
+The Qt port of WebKit currently compiles and runs on Linux, *BSD, Windows and macOS.

+# ECMEnableSanitizers
+# -------------------
+#
+# Enable compiler sanitizer flags.
+#
+# The following sanitizers are supported:
+#
+# - Address Sanitizer
+# - Memory Sanitizer
+# - Thread Sanitizer
+# - Leak Sanitizer
+# - Undefined Behaviour Sanitizer
+#
+# All of them are implemented in Clang, depending on your version, and
+# there is an work in progress in GCC, where some of them are currently
+# implemented.
+#
+# This module will check your current compiler version to see if it
+# supports the sanitizers that you want to enable
+#
+# Usage
+# =====
+#
+# Simply add::
+#
+#    include(ECMEnableSanitizers)
+#
+# to your ``CMakeLists.txt``. Note that this module is included in
+# KDECompilerSettings, so projects using that module do not need to also
+# include this one.
+#
+# The sanitizers are not enabled by default. Instead, you must set
+# ``ECM_ENABLE_SANITIZERS`` (either in your ``CMakeLists.txt`` or on the
+# command line) to a semicolon-separated list of sanitizers you wish to enable.
+# The options are:
+#
+# - address
+# - memory
+# - thread
+# - leak
+# - undefined
+#
+# The sanitizers "address", "memory" and "thread" are mutually exclusive.  You
+# cannot enable two of them in the same build.
+#
+# "leak" requires the  "address" sanitizer.
+#
+# .. note::
+#
+#   To reduce the overhead induced by the instrumentation of the sanitizers, it
+#   is advised to enable compiler optimizations (``-O1`` or higher).
+#
+# Example
+# =======
+#
+# This is an example of usage::
+#
+#   mkdir build
+#   cd build
+#   cmake -DECM_ENABLE_SANITIZERS='address;leak;undefined' ..
+#
+# .. note::
+#
+#   Most of the sanitizers will require Clang. To enable it, use::
+#
+#     -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++
+#
+# Since 1.3.0.

 - assert() has been changed to ASSERT()
 
-- Mass rename of udis86_input.h inp_ prefixed functions and macros to ud_inp_ to
-  avoid namespace pollution.
-
-- Removal of KERNEL checks.
-
-- Added #include of udis86_extern.h in udis86_decode.c.
-
-- Removed s_ie__pause and s_ie__nop from udis86_decode.c, since they weren't used.
-
-- Made udis86_syn.h use WTF_ATTRIBUTE_PRINTF. This required making a bunch of little
-  fixes to make the compiler's format string warnings go away.
-
-- Made the code in udis86_syn.h use vsnprintf() instead of vsprintf().
-
 - Fixed udis86_syn-att.c's jump destination printing to work correctly in 64-bit mode.
 
-- Add --outputDir option to itab.py.

+      The most important elements of each instruction definition are the
+      pfx (prefix), opc (opcode), and opr (operand) elements.  Each is a
+      CDATA element consisting of blank-separated words.  Upper and lower
+      case are equivalent.
+
+      <pfx></pfx>
+
+      pfx describes the set of valid prefixes that can precede the main
+      opcode without turning it into a different instruction. These may
+      be:
+
+      aso   accepts address size override
+      oso   accepts operand size override
+      seg   accepts a segment override
+      rexw, rexr, rexx, rexb
+            uses the indicated REX bit
+      vexl  accepts the vex.L prefix bit, in other words, the vexl
+            bit can be used in the decoding of the avx instruction.
+
+      <opr></opr>
+
+      [T][s]
+
+      Size Suffix
+      ===========
+
+      x     - If vex.L = 1 => m256/YMM
+                 vex.L = 0 => m128/XMM
+
+      opc words may be actual byte values (two hex digits), or may be one of
+      the following:
+      /sse=66,f3,f2 - required prefix (always first, and always
+        followed by 0f)
+      /3dnow=00-ff - this is a 3DNow opcode (only in a definition of the
+        form 0f 0f 3dnow=<byte>)
+      /a=16,32,64 - has this address size
+      /m=16,32,64,!64 - applicable only when the CPU is in this mode
+      /o=16,32,64 - has this operand size
+      /mod=11,!11 - has ModR/M with 11 or not-11 in the Mod field
+      /reg=0-7 - has ModR/M with this value in the reg field
+      /rm=0-7 - has ModR/M with this value in the R/M field (only with
+        /mod=11)
+      /x87=00-3f - X87 opcode with this value in the low 6 bits of the
+        following "ModR/M" byte (only with /mod=11 and no other modifiers)
+
+      opr words follow the Intel documentation somewhat, and specify the
+      location and the size of the operand.  The OperandDict table in
+      ud_itab.py maps these words to named OP_ and SZ_ constants for the
+      location and size respectively.  These constants are defined in
+      decode.h, q.v. for details.
+
+      The mode element affects instruction semantics but not decoding:
+          inv64 - invalid in 64-bit mode
+      def64 - default operand size is 64 bits in 64-bit mode
+
+      cpuid
+
+        The cpuid element maybe applied to an instruction or a specific
+        definition of the instruction. One ore more strings define the
+        cpuid features that the instruction (or a definition belongs to)
+
+        Values are: sse, sse2, sse3, sse4, sse4.1, sse4.2, avx
+
+      AVX Instructions
+
+      AVX instructions can be described in two ways. One, the explicit
+      form, and the other that promotes an existing sse instruction
+      definition to its avx form.
+
+      If an instruction is defined to be in cpuid=avx, but is defined in
+      the legacy form (using /sse= extensions), then the opcode generator
+      will infer that as two definitions, one the see instruction and the
+      other, an inferred avx instruction.
+
+      In generating the sse definition from the above, the following
+      transformations happen,
+
+        - /vexw and /vexl extensions (if any) are removed
+        - The operands H and L are removed. Operands specified on
+          the right to removed operands are shifted to the left
+          position.
+        - The vexl prefix is removed.
+        - "avx" is removed form the cpuid definition.
+
+     In generating the avx definition from the above, the following
+     transformations happen,
+
+        - c4 is inserted in the 0th position of the opcode string
+        - /sse extension is removed
+        - A new /vex extension is constructed using /sse, 0f, 38 and
+          3a opcodes (if any).
+        - Operands V, W, H, and U are marked explicitly to have the
+          size suffix "x"
+
+     If the above transformations do not generate the required
+     definitions, the instructions will need to be defined separately.

+# Qt Port of WebKit
+
+WebKit is an open source web browser engine. WebKit's HTML and JavaScript code began as a branch of the KHTML and KJS libraries from KDE. As part of KDE framework KHTML was based on Qt but during their porting efforts Apple's engineers made WebKit toolkit independent. QtWebKit is a project aiming at porting this fabulous engine back to Qt.
+
+The Qt port of WebKit currently compiles and runs on Linux, *BSD, Windows and macOS.

+# Building
